## GameBrah

GameBrah is a retro style gamepad interface intended for mobile devices with touch screens. The project is currently only the controller interface with no game library although simple test games will be developed once the interface is complete.  
  
To view GameBrah please go to [https://htmlpreview.github.io/](https://htmlpreview.github.io/) and input the link "https://github.com/xreddr/GameBrah/blob/main/index.html"  
  
GameBrah will open jsut fine on most browsers and platforms but opening on Iphone or in Safari may distort the CSS. Cross platform functionality is important and is a focus of the interface.

# In Development

- Functionality for Iphone and Safari
- Canvas instances for background, player-ground, and foreground
- Simple games to add value to the control interface
